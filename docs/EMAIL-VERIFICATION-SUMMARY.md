## How It Works Now

### Current Flow

1. User enters email on signup page
2. App generates 6-digit code
3. Code saved to database
4. **NEW**: App attempts to send email via Resend
5. If email succeeds:
   - ‚úÖ User receives email with code
   - ‚úÖ Console logs: `[SEND-CODE] Email sent successfully!`
6. If email fails (no API key or unverified email):
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Console logs the code for development
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows helpful error message
   - ‚úÖ App still works in development mode

### Development Mode Benefits

- **Failsafe**: If Resend isn't configured, code is logged to console
- **Flexibility**: Works with or without Resend setup
- **Demo-friendly**: Can show both methods during presentation

## Configuration Options

### Option 1: Resend Testing Domain (Current - Recommended)

**Sender**: `onboarding@resend.dev`
**Recipients**: Only verified emails
**Cost**: FREE
**Setup time**: 5 minutes

**Best for**: Development, testing, demos

**No additional configuration needed!** Just add your API key and verify your email.

---

### Option 2: Custom Domain (Optional)

**Sender**: `noreply@yourdomain.com`
**Recipients**: Anyone
**Cost**: ~$1-10/year for domain
**Setup time**: 15-30 minutes

**Best for**: Production deployment

**To enable**:
1. Buy a domain (e.g., `uwmarketplace.xyz`)
2. Add domain to Resend
3. Configure DNS records
4. Add to `.env.local`:
   ```env
   RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=UW Marketplace <noreply@uwmarketplace.com>
   ```

See `RESEND-SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Console Logging Only (Fallback)

**No Resend setup required**

Just don't add the `RESEND_API_KEY` and the app will:
- Log verification codes to terminal console
- Still work perfectly for development
- Perfect for quick testing
