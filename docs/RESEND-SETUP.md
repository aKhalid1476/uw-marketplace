## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Resend Account

1. Go to [resend.com/signup](https://resend.com/signup)
2. Sign up with your email
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Get API Key

1. In the Resend dashboard, click **"API Keys"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "UW Marketplace Dev")
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### Step 3: Add API Key to Your App

1. Open your `.env.local` file
2. Add the API key:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_actual_key_here
   ```
3. Save the file
4. **Restart your dev server** (Ctrl+C, then `npm run dev`)

### Step 4: Verify Your Email (Important!)

Since you're using Resend's **testing domain**, you can only send emails to verified addresses.

1. In Resend dashboard, click **"Domains"**
2. You'll see the default domain called **"Onboarding"** or **"onboarding@resend.dev"**
3. Click on it
4. Scroll down to **"Email Addresses"**
5. Click **"Add Email Address"**
6. Enter your **@uwaterloo.ca** email
7. Click **"Send Verification"**
8. **Check your email** and click the verification link
9. Once verified, you'll see a green checkmark âœ…

### Step 5: Test It!

1. Go to your app's signup page
2. Enter your verified **@uwaterloo.ca** email
3. Click "Send Verification Code"
4. **Check your email inbox** - you should receive a verification code!
5. Enter the code and complete signup

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to send verification email"

**Check:**
1. âœ… API key is correct in `.env.local`
2. âœ… Dev server was restarted after adding API key
3. âœ… Your email is verified in Resend dashboard
4. âœ… Check terminal/console for error messages

**Console logs to look for:**
```
[SEND-CODE] Attempting to send verification email to: user@uwaterloo.ca
[SEND-CODE] Email sent successfully!
```

If you see an error instead, it will tell you what went wrong.

### Email Not Arriving

**Possible causes:**
1. **Email not verified**: Make sure you verified your email in Resend dashboard
2. **Spam folder**: Check your spam/junk folder
3. **Wrong email**: Make sure you entered the same email you verified
4. **API limit**: Free tier is 100 emails/day - check your Resend dashboard

### Fallback Mode

If email sending fails, the app will **still work** in development mode:
- The verification code will be logged to your terminal
- Look for the code in your console:
  ```
  ðŸ“§ VERIFICATION CODE FOR: user@uwaterloo.ca
  ðŸ”‘ CODE: 123456
  ```
- You can still complete signup using this code

## Testing Domain vs. Custom Domain

### Testing Domain (Current Setup)
- **From**: `onboarding@resend.dev`
- **To**: Only verified email addresses
- **Cost**: FREE
- **Best for**: Development, testing, demos
- **Limitation**: Must verify each recipient email

### Custom Domain (Optional)
- **From**: `noreply@yourdomain.com`
- **To**: Anyone
- **Cost**: Domain name (~$1-10/year)
- **Best for**: Production, public deployment
- **Setup**: See "Custom Domain Setup" below

---

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

If you want to send emails from your own domain (e.g., `uwmarketplace.com`):

### 1. Buy a Domain

**Cheap options:**
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com) - `.xyz` for ~$1/year
- [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com) - Good prices
- [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com) - ~$10/year

### 2. Add Domain to Resend

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **"Domains"**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `uwmarketplace.com`)
4. Click **"Add"**

### 3. Configure DNS Records

Resend will show you DNS records to add. Copy these to your domain registrar:

**Example records:**
```
Type: TXT
Name: _resend
Value: resend-verification=abc123...

Type: MX
Name: @
Value: mx.resend.com
Priority: 10

Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:resend.com ~all

Type: TXT
Name: resend._domainkey
Value: p=MIGfMA0GCS...
```

### 4. Verify Domain

1. After adding DNS records, click **"Verify"** in Resend
2. Wait a few minutes for DNS propagation
3. Once verified, you'll see a green checkmark âœ…

### 5. Update Your App

In `.env.local`, add:
```env
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=UW Marketplace <noreply@uwmarketplace.com>
```

Restart your dev server, and emails will now come from your domain!

---

## Email Template

The verification email looks like this:

**Subject**: UW Marketplace - Your Verification Code

**Body**:
```
Your Verification Code

Welcome to UW Marketplace! Please use the code below to verify your email address.

[123456]

This code will expire in 10 minutes.

If you didn't request this code, please ignore this email.

Happy selling!
The UW Marketplace Team
```

You can customize this in `/lib/email-templates.ts`
